# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab advised by [Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/) at New York University. My research is supported by the [NSERC PGS-D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/BellandPostgrad-BelletSuperieures_eng.asp) scholarship. I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science advised by [Richard Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/) and B.A.Sc in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) from the University of Toronto.

Recently, my work is focused on:

- Unsupervised visual representation learning using minimally curated data -- specifically first-person, long-form and multi-object videos with no obvious subject, foreground, or background.
- The impact of architectural elements in ViTs like patchification, non-spatial tokens and positional embeddings and their effect on learned representations.

Looking ahead, I'd also like to explore the limits of video benchmarks and what they may, or may not, be telling us about our video representations. Finally, I'm interested in the use of 3D and video understanding in reasoning with large pretrained language models.
