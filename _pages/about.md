# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! \\
I'm a 4th year PhD at NYU [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) working with [Pavel Izmailov](https://izmailovpavel.github.io), [Yutong Bai](https://yutongbai.com/) and [Amir Bar](https://www.amirbar.net/).

I'm interested in vision, world models, planning and search. \\
Some specifics include: 
* Improving world model efficiency, consistency and structure.
* Using search to improve high-dimension and long-horizon planning.

Previously, I worked on visual representation learning, often for videos.

I received my Master's working with [Richard Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/) and my BASc in Engineering Science (Robotics) from the University of Toronto. \\
My work is supported by [NSERC PGS-D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/cgrsd-besrd_eng.asp).

Feel free to reach to me at **anw2067 [at] nyu.edu**\\
\\
I also love to eat, cook, drink coffee (ultralights; pourover, soup), and recently, drink wine.
