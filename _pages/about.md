# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a CS graduate student currently working with [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php) at the University of Toronto. 
My undergraduate degree (B.A.Sc. in Engineering Science, robotics specialization) was also completed here.

I am still in the early stages of my research career, so I'm frequently interested by new topics that I come across -- interesting models, generaliazation and statistical methods. So far, my work has been in vision, generative models, representation learning and learning in low-data regimes.

Looking forward, I hope to work on representation and transfer learning. I believe that many phenomena are interrelated, and that there is work to be done on using unlabelled, loosely-aligned data to solve complex problems. 
I'm interested in learning about statistical methods to characterize this and how we can learn structured models and representations, as well as relaxing the rigid problem-dataset pairing that is sometimes upheld.

When not trying to fix experiments, I like to work out, run and (try to) host dinner parties for my roommates and close friends.
