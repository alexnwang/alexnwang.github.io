# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Welcome to my personal research website! I am a MSc-CS candidate advised by [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php) at the University of Toronto. My undergraduate BASc in Engineering Science degree was also completed here.

My work thus far has been in representation learning, specifically, generative models to capture interesting visual features for downstream visual understanding and few-shot tasks. Otherwise, I have been periodically interested in self-supervised learning, optimization phenomena, score-based generative models, implicit functions and some convex optimization. I also have an unactioned curiosity on the impact of social media recommender systems on misinformation and our capacity for societal discourse.

When not trying to make models, or myself, learn something useful about the world, I enjoy cooking, reading manga, going to the gym or a light jog somewhere. 

Feel free to contact me at **alexw [at] cs.toronto.edu**
