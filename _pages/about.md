# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) lab advised by [Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/) at New York University. My research is supported by the [NSERC PGS-D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/BellandPostgrad-BelletSuperieures_eng.asp) scholarship. I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science advised by [Richard Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/) and B.A.Sc in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) from the University of Toronto.

My research is focused on vision-centric machine learning. In particular, I am interested in:
* **Self-supervised representation learning**\
  How single-subject (iconic) datasets like ImageNet have influenced architectures, augmentation techniques, learned representations and ultimately the ability to learn from dense, real-world image and video data?
* **Impact on on large-scale vision**\
  How these iconic representations and training methods influence large-scale multimodal and vision models? Alternatively, can a strong semantic model like DINOv2 support the training of more general, generative vision models?
* **Learning from synthetic data**\
  How synthetic data can contribute to visual understanding, particularly the distinction between learning effective visual features vs. real-world concepts and classes using generated images?

Looking ahead, I believer there may be inherent limitations to SSL methods stemming from their development around ImageNet data. However, I believe these models and their representations will serve as a strong foundation upon which to build large-scale generative vision models.
