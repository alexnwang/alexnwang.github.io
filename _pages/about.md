# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm a third year Ph.D. student in [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) advised by [Mengye Ren](https://mengyeren.com/) at NYU. I did my M.Sc. with [Rich Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/) and B.A.Sc in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto. I am supported by the [NSERC PGS-D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/BellandPostgrad-BelletSuperieures_eng.asp) scholarship. 

I'm interested in intelligent, video generation models. Through generations conditioned on prior frames, I aim to define and measure a notion of visual intelligence and reasoning.

My current research focuses on:
* Leveraging existing discriminative models and pretrained representations to improve the semantic content of generated videos
* Constructing a notion of visual reasoning by measuring generation semantics in response to (non-textual) changes in input context 

Previously, my work focused on representation learning, for which I am interested in new evaluation methods utilizing generative (text or image) responses.

When not working, I like to:\
host dinner parties, make pourover coffee, [watch movies with friends](https://chill-flat-b3e.notion.site/7bff3a7dd0f64726b092cae6c7bfb150?v=21b1ac1e12824c39b6e731967964c5f9) and practice (olympic) weightlifting.
