# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! I'm a fourth year PhD in [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) at NYU. \\
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Pavel Izmailov](https://izmailovpavel.github.io/) and to collaborate with [Yutong Bai](https://yutongbai.com/) and [Amir Bar](https://www.amirbar.net/).

My research interests lie in visual generation and representation learning to support planning, reasoning and other robotics tasks.
Some specifics include:
* How to plan for complex robots in real-life environments using world models.
* Building new quantitative metrics to improve generative world models for robotics tasks.
* Reducing compute demands of generative world models to enable real-time planning.

Previously, my work focused on learning representations from video data.

I received my MSc working with [Richard Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/) \\
and my BASc in Engineering Science (Robotics) from the University of Toronto. \\
I am supported by the [NSERC PGS-D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/cgrsd-besrd_eng.asp) scholarship.

Feel free to reach to me at **anw2067 [at] cims.nyu.edu**
